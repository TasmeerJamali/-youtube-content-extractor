# System Architecture Document

## Overview
The YouTube Idea-Based Content Extractor Agent is designed as a microservices-based system with clear separation of concerns and modular architecture for scalability and maintainability.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Modularity
Each component is designed as an independent module with well-defined interfaces, enabling easy testing, maintenance, and extension.

### 2. Scalability
The system uses asynchronous processing, caching strategies, and horizontal scaling capabilities to handle high loads.

### 3. Reliability
Implements circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation to ensure system stability.

### 4. Performance
Optimized data structures, efficient algorithms, and caching strategies ensure fast response times.

## Component Architecture

### Input Processing Module
```python
class InputProcessor:
    """
    Processes natural language video ideas and converts them into structured queries.
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Natural language understanding
    - Keyword extraction
    - Intent classification
    - Query optimization
    """
```

### YouTube API Wrapper
```python
class YouTubeAPIWrapper:
    """
    Handles all interactions with YouTube Data API v3.
    
    Features:
    - Rate limiting and quota management
    - Error handling and retries
    - Response caching
    - Batch processing
    """
```

### Content Analysis Engine
```python
class ContentAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyzes video content for classification and relevance scoring.
    
    Capabilities:
    - Video metadata analysis
    - Content type classification
    - Engagement metrics processing
    - Quality assessment
    """
```

### Semantic Matching System
```python
class SemanticMatcher:
    """
    Implements advanced NLP techniques for content matching.
    
    Techniques:
    - Sentence embedding similarity
    - TF-IDF vectorization
    - Cosine similarity calculations
    - Contextual understanding
    """
```

### Database Layer
```python
class DatabaseManager:
    """
    Manages all data persistence and retrieval operations.
    
    Features:
    - Connection pooling
    - Query optimization
    - Transaction management
    - Data integrity enforcement
    """
```

### Caching System
```python
class CacheManager:
    """
    Implements intelligent caching strategies.
    
    Strategies:
    - LRU cache for frequent queries
    - Time-based expiration
    - Cache warming
    - Distributed caching
    """
```

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input → Input Processor → Query Builder → YouTube API
                                    ↓
Cache Check ← Semantic Matcher ← Content Analyzer ← API Response
     ↓
Database Storage → Scoring Engine → Result Ranking → User Response
```

## Security Architecture

### API Security
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- API key validation
- Request sanitization
- CORS configuration

### Data Security
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure API communications
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
1. **L1 Cache**: In-memory application cache
2. **L2 Cache**: Redis distributed cache
3. **L3 Cache**: Database query cache

### API Optimization
- Request batching
- Parallel processing
- Connection pooling
- Lazy loading

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Read replicas

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- Load balancer support
- Container orchestration
- Auto-scaling capabilities

### Vertical Scaling
- Memory optimization
- CPU-intensive task optimization
- Database performance tuning
- Resource monitoring

## Error Handling Strategy

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5, timeout=30)
def youtube_api_call():
    # API call implementation
    pass
```

### Retry Mechanism
```python
@retry(max_attempts=3, backoff_factor=2)
def process_video_content():
    # Content processing implementation
    pass
```

### Graceful Degradation
- Cached results when API is down
- Reduced functionality modes
- User notification system
- Fallback mechanisms

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Request/response times
- Error rates
- API quota usage
- Cache hit rates
